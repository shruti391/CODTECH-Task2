Project Overview: To-Do List
Description
The To-Do List application is a simple and user-friendly web-based tool designed to help users manage and organize their tasks efficiently. The app allows users to add, edit, and delete tasks, providing a clean interface for task management. It also features persistent storage using localStorage, ensuring that tasks are saved and restored across browser sessions.

Key Features
Task Management: Users can add new tasks, edit existing ones, and delete tasks as needed. Each task is displayed in a list with options to modify or remove it.

Persistent Storage: Tasks are saved in the browser's localStorage, so they persist even when the page is refreshed or reopened later. This ensures that users do not lose their tasks.

Interactive UI: The application features a visually appealing design with interactive elements, including animations for task addition and hover effects for buttons.

Responsive Design: The app is designed to be responsive and works well on various screen sizes, from mobile devices to desktop screens.

User Feedback: Clear visual feedback is provided through animations and color changes for actions like editing and deleting tasks.

Technical Details
HTML: Structures the application with a container for the to-do list, a form for task input, and an unordered list for displaying tasks.
CSS: Styles the application with a modern look, including background colors, border styles, transitions, and hover effects to enhance user interaction.
JavaScript: Manages task operations and interactions. It handles form submissions, task additions, edits, deletions, and updates the localStorage to ensure tasks are saved and loaded correctly.
